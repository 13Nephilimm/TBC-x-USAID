Technologies I used for this project:
1. JavaScript ES6 - for cleaner and more organized code
2. CSS grid, Flexbox - for better performance, modern code and easy for responsive web.
3. HTML - for simple project structure

Project Structure:
I used relevant class names, function names and variable names because code will be easy readable for others. also it make a lot of sense.
it's fully responsive on any device (PC, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile). In HTML structure I used semantic HTML tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.
